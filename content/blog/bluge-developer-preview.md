Today we flipped the switch, and the [Bluge repository](https://github.com/blugelabs/bluge/) is now open to the public. Bluge is open-source and distributed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). No launch ever goes completely smoothly, so please be patient while we wire up all the continuous integration and get the badges updated.

Sponsors of my work were invited to introductory session this afternoon, and the initial response seems positive. A recording of the session will be made available in the future.  Want access now?  [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mschoch).
