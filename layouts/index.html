          <a href="https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/">Bleve</a> is the core project at the heart of Bluge Labs today.  Started in 2014 at <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>, Bleve has come a long way.  Today there are many companies shipping products that rely on Bleve indexing and search.  Bluge Labs' role is to ensure that Bleve remains a healthy open-source project with regular releases.

          <h3>Vellum</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/vellum">Vellum</a> is a library implementing a data-structure known as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4872115/what-is-a-finite-state-transducer">Finite State Transducer</a>.  Today it's primarily used internally by the Bleve code base.  However, there are projects using Vellum directly, and we believe it's full potential has not been realized.  Here at Bluge Labs, we plan to continue to support Vellum, and encourage wider adoption of this technology.
