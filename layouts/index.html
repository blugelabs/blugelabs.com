          <h3>Vellum</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/vellum">Vellum</a> is a library implementing a data-structure known as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4872115/what-is-a-finite-state-transducer">Finite State Transducer</a>.  Today it's primarily used internally by the Bleve code base.  However, there are projects using Vellum directly, and we believe its full potential has not been realized.  Here at Bluge Labs, we plan to continue to support Vellum, and encourage wider adoption of this technology.
